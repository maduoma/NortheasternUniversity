# What is the upper bound of the confidence interval?

#The resulting output relate to performing a t-test on the 'Time_Since_Last_Purchase' data from the Walmart data set. The goal of this test is to determine the 95% confidence interval for the mean time since the last purchase by Walmart customers.

#The t-test is an appropriate statistical tool when you want to estimate the mean of a population and the population standard #deviation is unknown. It's widely used for smaller sample sizes or when the data does not necessarily follow a normal #distribution.

#The output of this test:

#"Lower Bound of Confidence Interval: 9.11"
#"Upper Bound of Confidence Interval: 11.37"
#This means that based on the sample data from Walmart, we can be 95% confident that the true mean of the #'Time_Since_Last_Purchase' for the entire customer population lies between 9.11 and 11.37 days. In other words, the average #number of days since the last purchase for all Walmart customers is estimated to fall within this range with a 95% level of #confidence.

#This confidence interval gives us an idea of the precision of our estimate of the mean time since the last purchase. A narrower #interval would indicate a more precise estimate, while a wider interval would suggest less precision.

#The outputs are about performing a t-test on the 'Spending_Last_Year' data from the Walmart data set, aiming to determine the 95% confidence interval for the mean spending by a customer last year.

#The t-test is a statistical test that is useful for comparing the mean of a sample to a known value (in this case, the mean #spending of Walmart customers). It's particularly effective in cases where the population standard deviation is unknown and the #sample size is small or does not strictly adhere to a normal distribution.

#The results of this test:

#"Lower Bound of Confidence Interval for Spending Last Year: 1047.16"
"Upper Bound of Confidence Interval for Spending Last Year: 1052.21"
#These results indicate that, based on the sampled data, we can be 95% confident that the true average spending of all Walmart #customers last year falls between $1047.16 and $1052.21. This range represents our best estimate for the average annual #spending of a Walmart customer, with a 95% level of confidence.

#The relatively narrow range of this confidence interval suggests a high level of precision in our estimate of the average #spending. It provides valuable insights into customer spending behavior, which can be utilized for business analysis, marketing #strategies, and financial forecasting.

#The output, "Lower Bound of Confidence Interval: 0.21, Upper Bound of Confidence Interval: 0.38," represents the 95% #confidence interval for a proportion derived from a statistical test (likely a two-sample z-test for proportions). This #interval suggests that, with 95% confidence, the true proportion of the population being studied (in this case, customers who #either shopped or did not shop last month at Walmart) lies between 21% and 38%.

#In practical terms, if this confidence interval pertains to the proportion of customers who shopped last month, it means we can #be 95% confident that between 21% to 38% of all customers made a purchase last month. This range provides a measure of the #reliability and precision of the estimated proportion, indicating that the true proportion is likely within these bounds, based #on the sample data analyzed.

# The output "Lower Bound of Confidence Interval: 0.18, Upper Bound of Confidence Interval: 0.4" represents the 99% confidence # interval for a proportion determined through a statistical analysis (likely a two-sample z-test for proportions).

#In this context, the confidence interval indicates that, with 99% certainty, the true proportion of the population being #examined (such as the proportion of Walmart customers who either shopped or did not shop last month) falls between 18% and 40%.

#This wider interval, as compared to a 95% confidence interval, reflects a higher degree of certainty about where the true #proportion lies. In practical terms, if this is related to the proportion of customers who shopped last month, it implies that #we are 99% confident that the actual percentage of all customers who made a purchase last month is somewhere between 18% and #40%. The 99% confidence level provides a higher level of assurance about the estimate, but it also results in a broader range, #reflecting increased uncertainty about the precise proportion.

cat("Lower Bound of Confidence Interval:", ci_lower, "\n")
cat("Upper Bound of Confidence Interval:", ci_upper, "\n")

#The output "Lower Bound of Confidence Interval: 0.22, Upper Bound of Confidence Interval: 0.36" represents the 90% confidence #interval for a proportion determined through a statistical test, likely a two-sample z-test for proportions.

#This confidence interval suggests that, with 90% certainty, the true proportion of the population being analyzed (such as the #proportion of Walmart customers who shopped or did not shop last month) lies between 22% and 36%.

#Since this is a 90% confidence interval, it offers a lower degree of certainty compared to a 95% or 99% confidence interval, #but as a trade-off, it provides a narrower range. In practical terms, if this interval pertains to the proportion of customers #who shopped last month, it implies we can be 90% confident that the actual percentage of all customers who made a purchase last #month is somewhere between 22% and 36%. The 90% confidence level indicates a moderate level of assurance about the estimate, #with a relatively tighter range indicating less uncertainty about the precise proportion

# 10. In the question above, which confidence level generates the widest confidence interval? 

#In statistics, the width of a confidence interval is directly related to the level of confidence chosen. A higher confidence #level results in a wider confidence interval, while a lower confidence level leads to a narrower interval. This is because a #higher confidence level requires more range to ensure that the true population parameter is captured within the interval.

#From the questions above, three different confidence levels were used: 90%, 95%, and 99%. Among these:

#A 90% confidence level will generate the narrowest confidence interval.
#A 95% confidence level will provide a wider interval than the 90% level.
#A 99% confidence level will generate the widest confidence interval of all.

##Therefore, the confidence level that generates the widest confidence interval is the 99% confidence level.
