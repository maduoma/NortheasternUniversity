# Answer each question in the assignment using R. 

# This assignment is based on code covered in class. Some questions build on old code. Some questions require you to use new functions by looking up the R documentation. There is more than one way to answer a question. 

# The lab will be graded after the due date. The attempt with the highest score will be kept.

# 1. A random sample of 100 observations is selected from a normal population. The sample mean was 407 and the sample standard deviation 6. Using the 0.95 confidence level. Conduct a one-sample t-test to test the null hypothesis that the population mean = 400. 

# Answer the questions below. 

# a. State the null and alternative hypotheses. 

# Null Hypothesis (H0): The population mean is 400 (mu = 400).
# Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The population mean is not 400 (mu != 400).

# b. What is the critical value of t-test using the normal (z) distribution? Use the qnorm() function. Round the answer to nearest 2 decimals.

# Critical value for a two-tailed test at 95% confidence level using normal distribution
alpha <- 0.05
critical_value <- qnorm(1 - alpha/2)
critical_value # Display the critical value

# c. What is the value of the test statistic? Round the answer to nearest 2 decimals.

set.seed(100) # Ensuring reproducibility

# Generates the sample
sample_size <- 100
sample_mean <- 407
sample_std_dev <- 6
sample <- rnorm(sample_size, mean = sample_mean, sd = sample_std_dev)

# Performs the one-sample t-test
test_result <- t.test(sample, mu = 400)

test_result$statistic # Displays the test statistic

# Creates the data with the specified statistics using the code below. Then use the t.test() function.

set.seed(100) # set.seed() will generate the same random sample each time
sample = rnorm(100, mean = 407, sd = 6)

# d. Is the test statistic greater or less than the critical value? 

# You compare the absolute value of the test statistic to the critical value.
# If the test statistic is greater than the critical value, it suggests rejecting the null hypothesis.
test_result$statistic > critical_value

# e. What is the p-value of the hypothesis test? 
# Using the previous test result
p_value <- test_result$p.value

p_value # Display the p-value


```

```{r}
# 2. In the question above, can you conclude that the population mean is different from 400? 
# Yes, I conclude that the population mean is different from 400.

#Reason:
#The test statistic calculated from the sample data was significantly greater than the critical value obtained from the z-distribution. In our case, the test statistic was approximately 10.90, whereas the critical value for a 95% confidence level was ±1.96. This large test statistic suggests a substantial difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized population mean of 400.

#Additionally, the p-value of the hypothesis test was very close to 0. A p-value this small (typically ≤ 0.05 is considered significant) indicates a very low probability of observing such a sample mean from a population with a mean of 400, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

#Based on these results, we reject the null hypothesis that the population mean is 400 and conclude that the population mean is indeed different from 400.

# 3. A sales manager claims that the sales representatives make an average of 40 sales calls per week on professors. Several reps say that this estimate is too low. To investigate, a random sample of 30 sales representatives reveals that the mean number of calls made last week was 42. The standard deviation of the sample is 2.1 calls. Using the 0.95 confidence level, conduct a hypothesis test to test whether the mean number of calls per salesperson per week is greater than 40.

# Answer the questions below. 

# a. State the null and alternative hypotheses. 
# Null Hypothesis (H0): Mean number of calls = 40 (mu = 40).
# Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Mean number of calls > 40 (mu > 40).


# b. What is the critical value of t-test using the normal (z) distribution? Use the qnorm() function. Round the answer to nearest 2 decimals.
# Since the sample size is less than 30, use the t-distribution

# d. Is the test statistic greater or less than the critical value? 
# Checks if test statistic is greater than the critical value

# e. What is the p-value of the hypothesis test? 
# Calculates the p-value for a one-tailed test

# 4. In the question above, can you conclude that number of calls per salesperson per week is greater than 40?

#Interpretation of R Code Results:
#Test Statistic: The calculated test statistic was significantly greater than the critical value obtained from the t-distribution. This indicates that the sample mean is much higher than the hypothesized population mean of 40 calls per week.

#P-value: The p-value was approximately 0.00, which is significantly lower than the typical alpha level of 0.05 used for significance testing.

#Conclusion:
#Given these results (a large test statistic and a very small p-value), we have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis (H0 : μ = 40) in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H1 : μ > 40). 

# Therefore, it can be concluded that the number of calls per salesperson per week is greater than 40.

# 5. Suppose mean income per person in the United States is $60,000, and the distribution of incomes follows a normal distribution. A random sample of 100 residents of Wilmington, Delaware, had a mean of $70,000 with a standard deviation of $10,000. At the 0.95 confidence level, is that enough evidence to conclude that residents of Wilmington, Delaware, have more income than the national average?
