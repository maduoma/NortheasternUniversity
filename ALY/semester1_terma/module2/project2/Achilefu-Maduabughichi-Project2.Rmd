# Assignment Part 1

```{r}
# 1. Read the data set 2015.csv and store it in a variable called data_2015. You can test that you loaded it correctly with the code utilizing the head function below.

# Reads the CSV file
data_2015 <- read.csv("2015.csv")

# Displays the first few rows of the dataset
head(data_2015)

```

```{r}
# 2. Use the function names to produce the column names for your data set.

# Prints the column names
names(data_2015)

```

```{r}
# 3. Use the view function to view the data set in a separate tab.

# Views the data set in a separate tab
# view(data_2015)
data_2015

```

```{r}
# 4. Use the glimpse function to view your data set in another configuration.

# Views the data set in different configuration or format
glimpse(data_2015)

```

```{r}
# 5. Use p_load to install the janitor package. Janitor has a function called clean_names that can be given a data frame to make the names more R friendly. Be sure to store the resulting converted data frame in a variable (use data_2015 again). Compare the columns names now to the ones before.

# Gets the janitor package
p_load(janitor)

data_2015 <- clean_names(data_2015)

# Prints the column names
data_2015

```

```{r}
# 6. 	Select from the data set the country, region, happiness_score, and freedom columns. Store this new table as happy_df.

# Country, region, happiness score, and freedom and saves them in happy_df variable
happy_df <- select(data_2015, country, region, happiness_score, freedom)

# Displays some few column names to make sure everything is fine
happy_df

```

```{r}
# 7. Slice the first 10 rows from happy_df and store it as top_ten_df.
top_ten_df <- slice(happy_df, 1:10)

# Displays the first 10 rows
top_ten_df

```

```{r}
# 8. From happy_df filter the table for freedom values under 0.20. Store this new table as no_freedom_df.

# Filters the happy_df table for freedom values under 0.20.
no_freedom_df <- filter(happy_df, freedom < 0.20)

# Displays the freedom values under 0.20
no_freedom_df
```

```{r}
# 9. Arrange the values in happy_df in descending order by their freedom values. Store this new table as best_freedom_df.

# Arranges the happy_df table in descending order by freedom values.
best_freedom_df <- arrange(happy_df, desc(freedom))

# Displays happy_df table in descending order by freedom values
best_freedom_df
```


```{r}
# 10. Create a new column with mutate in data_2015 called gff_stat. For each row, the gff_stat is the sum of the family, freedom, and generosity values. Store the resulting table right in the data_2015 variable.

# Combines gff_stat = family + freedom + generosity to get the gff_stat for each country.
data_2015 <- mutate(data_2015, gff_stat = family + freedom + generosity)

# Displays 
data_2015
  
```



```{r}
# 11. Summarize the happy_df data set. Your summary should contain the mean happiness_score in a column called mean_happiness, the max happiness_score in a column called max_happiness, the mean freedom in a column called mean_freedom, and the max freedom in a column called max_freedom. Store the resulting table as happy_summary.

# 

happy_summary <- happy_df %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_happiness = mean(happiness_score, na.rm = TRUE), # Finds average happiness score
    max_happiness = max(happiness_score, na.rm = TRUE), # Gives the happiest of the happy value
    mean_freedom = mean(freedom, na.rm = TRUE), # Gives the freedom values on average.
    max_freedom = max(freedom, na.rm = TRUE)# Gives boundless freedom values
  )

# Reveals the summary of the data set
happy_summary

```

```{r}
# 12. Group the happy_df data set by region. Run a summary that provides the number of countries in each region in a column called country_count, the mean happiness for each region in a column called mean_happiness, and the mean freedom of each region in a column called mean_freedom. Store your resulting table in a variable called regional_stats_df.

# Explores the regions
regional_stats_df <- happy_df %>% 
  group_by(region) %>%  # Groups or gathers regions
  summarize(
    country_count = n(),  # Counts the nations in each region
    mean_happiness = mean(happiness_score, na.rm = TRUE),  # Averages joy of each region.
    mean_freedom = mean(freedom, na.rm = TRUE) # The average sense of freedom across regions
  ) %>% 
  ungroup()  # Sets each region free after the grouping

# Prints the regional values
regional_stats_df

```

```{r}
# 13. [Challenge Problem] Compare the average gdp per capita of the ten least happy Western European countries with the ten happiest Sub-Saharan African countries. For testing, you can store the resulting data.frame or table as gdp_df.


# Use the column name directly for GDP per capita
gdp_column_name <- "economy_gdp_per_capita"

# Explore the ten least happy Western European countries
west_europe_least_happy <- data_2015 %>%

# 14. [Challenge problem] From your regional_stats_df, create a scatterplot of mean_happiness vs. mean_freedom. Draw a line segment from the smallest of these values to the largest.

# Draws the scatterplot of mean_happiness and mean_freedom
ggplot(regional_stats_df, aes(x = mean_freedom, y = mean_happiness)) +

# 19. In a separate report, make a recommendation for the league most valuable player (MVP). Keep in mind that the dataset completely ignores pitchers. You can decide whether a pitcher should be eligible for the MVP. Base your decision on the data you have analyzed. You may choose to do additional analysis at your discretion. You should produce a concise, written executive summary that, in addition to the title page and citations, contains an introduction, presentation of written key findings supported by visualizations, and a conclusion that contains your recommendations as supported by the data. Your executive summary should adhere to basic APA guidelines.
